If the independent features are correlated with each other it may affect the performance of the classifier. 3. It is quite sensitive to noise and overfitting. 4. Logistic Regression should not be used if the number of observations is lesser than the number of features, otherwise, it may lead to overfitting. 5. By using Logistic Regression, non-linear problems can't be solved because it has a linear decision surface. But in real-world scenarios, the linearly separable data is rarely found."

        "The various components of component-based systems are as follows: Preprocessing and feature extraction: Content-based systems are used in a wide variety of domains, such as Web pages, product descriptions, news, music features, and so on. In most cases, features are extracted from these various sources to convert them into a keyword-based vector-space representation. This is the first step of any content-based recommendation system, and it is highly domain-specific. However, the proper extraction of the most informative features is essential for the effective functioning of any content-based recommender system. Content-based learning of user profiles: A content-based model is specific to a given user. Therefore, a user-specific model is constructed to predict user interests in items, based on their history of either buying or rating items. To achieve this goal, user feedback is leveraged, which may be manifested in the form of previously specified ratings (explicit feedback) or user activity (implicit feedback). Such feedbacks are used in conjunction with the attributes of the items to construct the training data. A learning model is constructed on this training data. The resulting model is referred to as the user profile because it conceptually relates user interests to item attributes. Filtering and recommendation: In this step, the learned model from the previous steps is used to make recommendations on items for specific users. This step needs to be very efficient because the predictions need to be performed in real-time."
